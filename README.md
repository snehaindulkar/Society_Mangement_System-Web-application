This project has been submitted in the fulfillment of the requirements. We the team members of this project, take pleasure in presenting 
the detail project report that reflects our efforts in the academic year 2017-2018. HOUSING SOCIETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is about managing 
the works of society. This software is design to automate functionality of a society’s activities. Together society members & society 
committee members will now browse through a common web portal where society members will have details regarding their maintenance & 
society activities and society committee will have maintenance notices & many more services

1.1	Introduction:

      Our project is thus based on the PHP platform and is meant to better manage the functions of a housing society management system.  
      The functions of a housing society include solving members' grievances, collecting maintenance, issuing receipts for the same, 
      appointment of service providers and the list goes on. These functions are mostly entirely manual and are managed by the managing 
      committee of that housing society .Large directories are to be maintained which results in a huge amount of paper consumption in 
      today's time where almost everything is possible electronically. Residents are often left restless because of the lack of 
      communication and that they are unaware of where the society funds are utilized. The inevitable feature called transparency is 
      absent. 
      Proper management of the above tasks thus requires functionality based and automated web based application.The application also 
      integrates other dimensions of the functions of a housing society that includes society notice board for sharing information, 
      notifying members about the events to be held, easy discussion of members’ grievances and convenient communication within the 
      society members.Thus, the goal of the project is to develop an PHP application that will assist the housing society members 
      to play their roles more effectively. one time entry of maintenance charges and keeping a track of incoming and outgoing funds. 
      Whereas, residents register themselves with their apartment details and access the services like viewing maintenance charges and 
      financial reports thus keeping transparency intact.
